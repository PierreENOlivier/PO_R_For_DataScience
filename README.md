Exploration of methods using R for Data Science

In this project, I go through methods described in _R for Data Science_ 
by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund, as well as _Advanced R_ by Hadley Wickham.

I will also explore some concepts more deeply as I go through the books.

Steps of data science:
1. Data importation: bring data from other places into R or other analytic software
2. Tidying: organize the data into a format usable by statistical packages
3. Transformation: select and prepare the data needed for the analysis
4. Visualisation: explore questions through visualisation
5. Modelling: answer questions through modelling
6. Communication: communicate the results

Tidying + Transformation = Wrangling

Hypothesis generation vs. Hypothesis confirmation
1. Hypothesis generation: explore the data to uncover patterns, ask questions about processes, and explain the patterns
2. Hypothesis confirmation: develop a model that can reproduce the patterns in the data and confirm the theory
